      <h5>What is cloud computing?</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <div ALIGN=JUSTIFY><p>Cloud computing enables people to access software applications, data storage and other services over the internet instead of through traditional physical servers in a back office.
        The cloud computing model enables users of internet-based computing services to be charged for what they consume on a pay-per-use basis. This is often referred to as a consumption-based pricing model and is a departure from more traditional subscription-based pricing models.
        There are three main types of cloud services:
      </p></div>
    
        
        <p> <b>1. Software as a service (SaaS): </b> These are on-demand hosted services that provide access to business applications.</p>
        <p> <b>2. Platform as a service (PaaS): </b> These are web-based services and deployment of applications in the cloud.</p>
        <p> <b>3. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): </b> These are virtualized computing resources over the internet and often offer storage.</p>

        <div ALIGN=JUSTIFY><p>
        For many businesses, the attraction of cloud services lies in the fact that they don't need to buy and maintain their own physical technology products, software, storage and infrastructure.
        The cloud computing world is currently dominated by a handful of large, public cloud service providers (CSPs) and their products. These include AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. These vendors can deliver the same service to hundreds of thousands -- or even millions -- of customers of various sizes and across different industries at an attractive price point.

        applications to interact with one another for data exchange. Building, linking and integrating different workloads in the cloud often requires 
        the use of APIs. As a cloud professional, you must be adept at coding these APIs and the links used to integrate workloads into the cloud.
        The most common types of APIs used in the cloud are REST and GraphQL.

        <p>
        Knowledge of networking basics, including how to establish connections across resources and locations, is an essential skill in the cloud.
        Cloud resources are often connected to on-premises locations enabling an organizations to establish services such as a virtual private cloud and secure 
        connectivity. The cloud also requires that the organization can effectively access cloud resources, which can require some network management.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In cloud workload deployments, virtual networks are commonly used with different approaches to enable networking connectivity across resources and sometimes 
        also across clouds, in multi-cloud deployments. All that requires networking skills.

        Data lies at the heart of cloud computing, so it is essential to understand how and where to store it. Depending on a business's needs and the type 
        and volume of its data, it may select one or more of the following types of storage:
      </p>
  
      
      <p> •	Personal cloud storage</p>
      <p> •	Public cloud storage</p>
      <p> •	Private cloud storage.</p>
      <p> •	Hybrid cloud storage</p>

      <p> <b>The benefits of cloud storage include the following: </b> </p>

      <p> •	Accessibility</p>
      <p> •	Reliability</p>
      <p> •	Fast deployment</p>
      <p> •	Data backup and recovery</p>
      <p> •	Lower cost</p>

      <p>
        In-depth understanding of how each type of cloud storage works is a valuable skill for cloud computing professionals.

      <h4><b>1. Cloud service platform expertise</b></h4>
      <div ALIGN=JUSTIFY><p>
        Gaining a thorough understanding of the CSP marketplace is a good starting point. Familiarize yourself with the three big public cloud computing platforms,
        which are AWS, Microsoft Azure and GCP. Other companies with cloud platforms include IBM, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, DigitalOcean and Alibaba Cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also several widely deployed open source technology platforms that are used by organizations and CSPs 
        alike to build public and private cloud services, including OpenStack and Apache CloudStack.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's essential to differentiate between providers in terms of which may be most appropriate to host different applications or on which to run 
        different types of workloads. You will need to be able to point out the pros and cons of each and select the best option to meet a specific need. 
        Each of the leading cloud platforms has its own strengths and each CSP also has its own cost structure.

          Among the most common programming languages are Java, JavaScript and Python, which are well suited for cloud-based software. 
          Developing database powered applications requires familiarity with SQL and data structure concepts, including data schemas.

        In today's cloud environments, the days when developers and operations support personnel worked in their own silos are long gone. 
        DevOps is the practice of harmonizing and integrating development and operations activities throughout the entire software development 
        and application service lifecycle, including design, development and production support. 
        </p>

        <p>
        This approach significantly reduces time to market for 
        applications and eliminates unnecessary bottlenecks. DevOps workflows also commonly involve the use of CI/CD services in the cloud, as well as 
        observability and monitoring for operations.

          The negative effect of the loss or breach of personal customer data or proprietary company intellectual property can be devastating for businesses 
          from both a reputational and financial perspective. Today, the demand for cybersecurity talent well outpaces its supply, and the ongoing rise in cloud

          In a hybrid cloud model, certain elements are retained on premises or in a dedicated private cloud, while less sensitive or more modern 
          applications are migrated to a public cloud. To make the correct decisions about what belongs where, cloud professionals will need an understanding 
          of how each cloud model works and how to unify them into a hybrid arrangement.

      <h4><b>11. Containers</b></h4>
      <div ALIGN=JUSTIFY><p>
        Containers provide a packaging mechanism in which applications may be abstracted from the environments in which they are running. This decoupling 
        process enables businesses to deploy container-based applications swiftly and consistently. Knowledge of today's most popular container technologies, 
        such as Docker and Kubernetes, will increase your likelihood of securing employment in a cloud computing role.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every major cloud platform now has some form of container or Kubernetes service to help organizations manage deployments, 
          and it's critical for cloud professionals to understand how they work.

        <div ALIGN=JUSTIFY><p>
          Moving software applications from a data center into a cloud environment is more complex than copying files from one server to another. 
          That's because applications running on premises often include software and even hardware dependencies that don't always directly translate 
          into the cloud, in a lift-and-shift approach.
        </p></div>

        <div ALIGN=JUSTIFY><p>
          As the cloud is a different environment, a thorough assessment needs to be undertaken before any cloud migration is carried out. The best cloud 
          professionals will treat each application on its own merits and be prepared to work with business stakeholders to chart the best course forward.
